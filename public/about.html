<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 19 year old developer, based in Rio de Janeiro Brazil and currently looking for the first opportunity in tech

  I have done a few projects using HTML, CSS and JS.<br />
  
  An opportunity as an intern would be really helpful to get me into the tech area and learn with more experienced developers

  Working abroad is not a problem for me as well as working from home as working remotely.
  Fluent in Norwegian, Portuguese and English.
